# Master Product Model

This document captures the design decisions, data model, and conventions for the **product master** in this POS scaffold. The goal is to give a future maintainer — human or AI agent — enough context to extend the system without re-deriving the rationale.

> **Status:** scaffold, frontend-only. No backend yet; all data is in-memory `$state` and resets on reload.
> **Last updated:** 2026-05-13 (Tax rates, Suppliers, Product images, Purchase Orders, Composite products, ProductKind discriminator, per-variant recipes, Extras, Customers, POS terminal + Orders added; consignment refactored to be PO-driven; scalar `Product.stock` / `ProductVariant.stock` removed and replaced by `Batch` rows with FIFO depletion; `Payout` entity + `/payouts` route ship the Consignor Payout report and return-to-consignor flow — see [`CONSIGNMENT.md`](./CONSIGNMENT.md) for the full design).

## Context

`/home/sandi/code/pos` is a SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 (runes) admin app for a Point-of-Sale system. The stack:

- SvelteKit 2 / Svelte 5 with `$state` / `$derived` / `$props` / `$bindable` / `$effect`
- Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config in `src/app.css`, brand palette + tokens)
- `lucide-svelte` icons
- TypeScript
- `@sveltejs/adapter-auto`

Currently shipped: **Master Data** routes (Employees, Categories, Units, Pricelists, Tax rates, Products, Suppliers, Customers), **Sales** routes (POS with scan-to-sell, Orders), **Procurement** routes (Purchase Orders with partial receipts + expiration capture, Payouts), and **Inventory** (`/inventory` with Stock Adjustment + Batches view + per-batch label print + bulk PO label print at `/inventory/po/[poId]/labels`). Still 404: Dashboard widgets (data), Reports, Settings.

This doc focuses on the **Product** master because its model is significantly richer than the other resources.

## The five dimensions of variation

A Product can vary along several orthogonal axes, but with a **kind discriminator** (`'goods' | 'composite'`) that gates which combinations make sense:

| Dimension | Example | Lives on | Goods | Composite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Customer tier** | Retail Rp 8.000 / Wholesale Rp 7.000 | `Product.prices: PricelistEntry[]` | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Quantity** | Buy 24+ for Rp 6.500 | `PricelistEntry.tiers: PricingTier[]` | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Packaging** | 1 pc / 6-pack / case of 24 | `Product.units: ProductPackaging[]` | ✓ | — |
| **Variant** | Red/S, Red/M, Blue/L | `Product.variants: ProductVariant[]` | ✓ | ✓ (with per-variant recipe) |
| **Pricing strategy** | Fixed, markup+amount, markup% | `PricelistEntry.pricing: PricingStrategy` | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Components (recipe / bundle)** | Combo = 1 espresso + 1 croissant | `Product.components: CompositeComponent[]` + per-variant | — | ✓ |
| **Extras / modifiers** | Extra cheese, extra sauce | `Product.extras: ProductExtra[]` | ✓ | ✓ |

Most products only use one or two dimensions. The form is designed so simple products see only the essentials and complex products opt into more, with the kind selector at the top of Basics filtering which feature chips appear.

**Tax** is orthogonal to pricing — it's applied on top of the computed sale price. Tax rate is resolved through a fallback chain: `Product.taxRateId` (optional override) → `Category.taxRateId` (category default) → global default `TaxRate.isDefault`. See [Tax](#tax) below.

## Data model

All types live in `src/lib/stores/products.svelte.ts`.

### `Product`

```ts
type ProductKind = 'goods' | 'composite';

type Product = {
  id: string;
  sku: string;
  name: string;
  kind: ProductKind;                              // discriminator — drives form gating
  categoryId: string;             // FK -> categories store
  unitId: string;                 // FK -> units store (base unit, e.g. "pcs")
  cost: number;                   // IDR per base unit; bootstrap value, not auto-updated by POs (see CONSIGNMENT.md)
  prices: PricelistEntry[];       // sale pricing per pricelist
  // stock is no longer a scalar field. Live stock is `stockOf(product.id)` summed
  // over matching `Batch` rows (see src/lib/stores/batches.svelte.ts).
  status: 'active' | 'archived';
  description: string;
  taxRateId?: string;             // optional override; inherits from category when omitted
  defaultSupplierId?: string;     // primary supplier; autofills new POs for this product
  imageUrl: string;               // URL or empty string; upload UI deferred to backend
  units: ProductPackaging[];      // additional packagings (base unit stays on `unitId`)
  attributes: ProductAttribute[]; // option templates for variant generation
  variants: ProductVariant[];
  components: CompositeComponent[]; // product-level recipe (used when no variants)
  extras: ProductExtra[];           // optional add-ons at sale time (sauces, toppings, gift wrap)
  requiresBatchLabel?: boolean;     // print a thermal label per received batch (perishables, lot-tracked)
  requiresExpiration?: boolean;     // capture expiration date on every batch; FIFO walks expiresAt ASC
};
```

There is **no `advanced` flag**. Use `isAdvanced(p)`, derived from `units.length || variants.length || attributes.length`.

### `PricingStrategy`, `PricelistEntry`, `PricingTier`

```ts
type PricingStrategy =
  | { kind: 'fixed'; value: number }          // sale = value
  | { kind: 'markup_amount'; value: number }  // sale = cost + value
  | { kind: 'markup_pct'; value: number };    // sale = cost × (1 + value/100)

type PricingTier = {
  minQty: number;
  pricing: PricingStrategy;
};

type PricelistEntry = {
  pricelistId: string;       // FK -> pricelists store
  pricing: PricingStrategy;  // base price (qty < smallest minQty)
  tiers: PricingTier[];      // ordered by ascending minQty; highest matching minQty wins
};
```

**Sale price is never stored.** Always compute via `computeSalePrice(cost, strategy)` or `priceForQty(entry, qty, cost)`.

### `ProductVariant`

```ts
type ProductVariant = {
  id: string;                      // uuid
  name: string;                    // display, e.g., "Red / Large"
  sku: string;
  cost: number;                    // own cost (used when components are empty); bootstrap value, not auto-updated by POs
  prices: PricelistEntry[];        // own pricing per pricelist
  // stock is derived from batches keyed by (productId, variantId).
  // Call `stockOf(productId, v.id)` to read it.
  barcode: string;
  values: Record<string, string>;  // {Color: "Red", Size: "Large"} — links to attributes
  imageUrl: string;                // URL or empty string
  components: CompositeComponent[]; // per-variant recipe (for composite kind only)
};
```

`values` is the structural key for the variant generator. Empty `values: {}` = manually-added variant; generated variants have a key per active attribute.

### `ProductPackaging`

```ts
type ProductPackaging = {
  unitId: string;              // e.g., "box"
  factor: number;              // how many base units this contains; e.g., 24
  prices: PricelistEntry[];
  barcode: string;
};
```

A packaging's effective cost is `factor × product.cost`. The base unit (`pcs`) is **not** repeated in `units[]`; it lives on `product.unitId`.

### `ProductAttribute`

```ts
type ProductAttribute = {
  id: string;
  name: string;        // e.g., "Color"
  values: string[];    // e.g., ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]
};
```

Drives the variant generator. `generateVariants(attrs, defaults)` returns the Cartesian product; `regenerateVariants(attrs, existing, defaults)` preserves edits on combos that still exist and drops orphans.

### `CompositeComponent`

```ts
type CompositeComponent = {
  id: string;
  productId: string;
  variantId?: string;
  quantity: number;     // in the component's base unit
};
```

A product is **composite** (a bundle or a recipe/BOM) when `components.length > 0`. The same model covers both:

- **Bundle**: "Coffee & Croissant Combo" — components are also sold individually
- **BOM / manufactured**: "Mie Tek-Tek = noodle + egg + mayo" — components may or may not be sold separately; whether they're individually sellable is just their `status` (active vs archived)

For composites, two product-level numbers are **derived** rather than stored:

- `effectiveCost(p) = sum(component.quantity × componentBaseCost)`. The product's manual `cost` field is ignored when components exist. Pricing strategies (markup_pct etc.) apply to this effective cost, so margins auto-update when component costs change.
- `producibleStock(p) = min(floor(componentStock / componentQuantity))`. "How many full units can we make from current ingredients?" Limited by the rarest component. Component stock is read via `stockOf(componentProductId, componentVariantId?)`.

The form switches the cost field to a read-only "Effective cost" display when components are present, and shows the read-only "Producible stock" derived from component availability. The form has **no Stok field** for goods either — stock is exclusively managed at `/inventory` (Stock Adjustment dialog / receive POs / sales / returns). This preserves the Produk = katalog / Inventaris = stok separation.

**Per-variant recipes**: when a composite product has variants, each variant has its own `components` array. Pricing math switches per-variant: `effectiveVariantCost(v) = sum(qty × componentCost)` when `v.components` is non-empty, else falls back to `v.cost`. Same for `producibleVariantStock`. The variant generator pre-seeds new variants with the product-level components as a starting point, then the user adjusts per variant (e.g., Combo Small: 1 noodle + 1 egg; Combo Large: 1 noodle + 3 eggs).

**Scaffold limitations:** components currently use the component product's base unit only (no sub-base units like "100 grams of flour" when flour's base is kg). The form's component product Select hides products that are themselves composite, to keep recursion out (no composite-of-composites yet).

### `ProductExtra`

```ts
type ProductExtra = {
  id: string;
  name: string;            // "Extra cheese"
  priceDelta: number;      // added to sale price when picked
  components: CompositeComponent[];  // optional stock impact when picked
};
```

Extras are **optional add-ons at sale time** that apply to either kind (goods or composite). Each extra carries a price delta added to the sale price and an optional list of components that get deducted from ingredient stock when the customer picks it. At the future POS terminal:

- `salePrice = baseProductPrice + sum(picked extras' priceDelta)`
- stock deducted: from base product/variant components + each picked extra's components

Extras are stored per product; no shared "modifier groups" master-data resource yet (could be added later for "Sauces" / "Toppings" reused across products). `required` flag (force-pick like "must choose size S/M/L") is **not implemented** in this scaffold — all extras are treated as optional toggles. Add it when POS sale UX needs single-select groups.

### `Supplier`

Lives in `src/lib/stores/suppliers.svelte.ts`. Master-data resource at `/suppliers`.

```ts
type Supplier = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  contactPerson: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  address: string;
  leadTimeDays: number;      // typical days from order to delivery
  status: 'active' | 'archived';
  notes: string;
};
```

Suppliers power Purchase Orders (see below). `Product.defaultSupplierId` is a soft reference to a primary supplier — used to autofill the supplier when creating a new PO for that product. If the supplier is deleted, the reference dangles harmlessly and `defaultSupplier(p)` returns undefined.

### `PurchaseOrder`

Lives in `src/lib/stores/purchaseOrders.svelte.ts`. Routes at `/purchase-orders` (list), `/purchase-orders/new`, `/purchase-orders/[id]` (detail), `/purchase-orders/[id]/edit`.

```ts
type PurchaseOrderType = 'standard' | 'consignment';
type PurchaseOrderStatus = 'draft' | 'sent' | 'partial' | 'received' | 'cancelled';

type PurchaseOrderLine = {
  id: string;
  productId: string;
  variantId?: string;       // required when product has variants
  quantity: number;         // ordered quantity (chosen unit)
  receivedQty: number;      // already received (chosen unit); 0 ≤ receivedQty ≤ quantity
  unitId: string;           // base unit or one of the product's packaging units
  unitFactor: number;       // base units per 1 of unitId; snapshot at PO creation
  unitPrice: number;        // IDR per unit (per chosen unit, not per base unit)
  notes: string;
};

type PurchaseOrder = {
  id: string;
  code: string;             // human-readable, auto-generated: PO-YYYY-NNN
  type: PurchaseOrderType;
  supplierId: string;
  status: PurchaseOrderStatus;
  orderDate: string;        // ISO date
  expectedDate: string;     // optional ISO date
  receivedDate: string;     // set when status -> received
  lines: PurchaseOrderLine[];
  notes: string;
};
```

**Status workflow:** `draft → sent → received` (one-way) with `cancelled` available from `draft` or `sent`. The detail page has the action buttons (`Mark as sent`, `Receive`, `Cancel`). Only drafts are editable.

**PO lines support packaging units.** A line can buy in the base unit OR any of the product's packaging units (a Cola line can buy "20 case at Rp 78.000" instead of "480 pcs at Rp 3.250"). The line stores `unitId` + `unitFactor` (factor is snapshotted at line creation so the PO doesn't drift if the product's packaging config changes later). The form's unit Select offers `base` and each packaging; when the user changes unit, `unitPrice` defaults to `(variant?.cost ?? product.cost) × factor`. Helpers `lineBaseQuantity(line)` and `lineBaseUnitCost(line)` convert to base units for display and stock math.

**Receive action** (`purchaseOrders.receive(id, opts?)`):
- Supports partial fulfillment. `opts.receiveQty` is a map `lineId → qty` (in the line's chosen unit). Omitted lines receive their full remaining `quantity − receivedQty`. Set qty to 0 to skip a line this round.
- For each line touched: creates one `Batch` row with `qtyReceived = qtyRemaining = qtyToReceive × unitFactor`, `unitCost = unitPrice / unitFactor`, `ownership = po.type === 'consignment' ? 'consignment' : 'owned'`, snapshotting `supplierId`, `sourcePurchaseOrderId`, `sourcePurchaseOrderLineId`, and `receivedAt`. The line's `receivedQty` is incremented by `qtyToReceive`.
- Status transitions: every line fully received → `received`; some but not all → `partial`. The PO can be received again from `partial` to complete remaining lines.
- Stock for the product/variant rises automatically because `stockOf(...)` sums batches. No scalar `product.stock` write happens any more.
- Cost is **not** auto-updated for either PO type. The manual `product.cost` / `variant.cost` field is the bootstrap value; live cost is `currentCost(productId, variantId?)` — weighted avg of owned batches' `unitCost`, falling back to the manual field when no owned batches exist. Consignment batches are deliberately excluded from `currentCost` since they aren't part of our cost basis.
- (Future) Standard PO will create an AP entry; consignment PO settles per-sale via the Consignor Payout report once the accounting / `/payouts` modules ship.

See [`CONSIGNMENT.md`](./CONSIGNMENT.md) §"Proposed implementation" for the full batch model.

**Consignment is now PO-driven.** There is no `consignment` field on Product anymore. A product is "on consignment" if it has at least one non-cancelled consignment-type PO referencing it. The helper `purchaseOrders.hasConsignmentFor(productId)` answers this; the products list page uses it to render the Consignment badge.

### `Customer` and pricelist assignment

Lives in `src/lib/stores/customers.svelte.ts`. Master-data resource at `/customers`.

```ts
type CustomerType = 'individual' | 'business';

type Customer = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: CustomerType;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  address: string;
  pricelistId: string;        // FK to Pricelist — drives checkout prices
  taxId: string;              // NPWP for businesses (Indonesian tax ID)
  status: 'active' | 'archived';
  notes: string;
  joinedAt: string;           // ISO date
};
```

Every customer has a `pricelistId`. When the POS terminal ships, selecting a customer at checkout switches the cart's effective pricelist to that customer's — drives `priceForQty` lookups for every line. Walk-in customers (no explicit customer selected at POS) use the global default pricelist (`pricelists.default()`).

The store exposes `customers.countByPricelist(id)` which the Pricelists list page uses to surface customer counts inline ("2 customers" linked back to `/customers?pricelist=pl_wholesale`). The `pricelist` URL query param pre-selects the pricelist filter on the customers list.

For Indonesian B2B compliance, business-type customers can store an `NPWP` (tax ID); the form shows that field only when `type === 'business'`. PPN-compliant invoices (future) will pull this onto the receipt.

### `Order` — sales from the POS terminal

Lives in `src/lib/stores/orders.svelte.ts`. Routes at `/pos` (terminal), `/orders` (list), `/orders/[id]` (detail).

```ts
type OrderStatus = 'paid' | 'cancelled';
type PaymentMethod = 'cash' | 'card' | 'qris' | 'transfer';

type OrderLineExtra = {
  extraId: string;
  name: string;            // snapshot
  priceDelta: number;      // snapshot
};

type OrderLine = {
  id: string;
  productId: string;
  variantId?: string;
  productName: string;     // snapshot for receipt durability
  variantName: string;     // snapshot
  unitId: string;
  unitFactor: number;      // snapshot
  unitCode: string;        // snapshot
  quantity: number;        // in chosen unit
  unitPrice: number;       // resolved after tier; snapshot
  extras: OrderLineExtra[];
  taxRatePct: number;      // snapshot of tax % at sale time
  lineSubtotal: number;    // qty × (unitPrice + Σ extras.priceDelta)
  lineTax: number;         // lineSubtotal × taxRatePct/100
  lineTotal: number;       // lineSubtotal + lineTax
  batchAllocations: BatchAllocation[];  // populated by applyOrderToStock at charge — exact batches drawn down, snapshotted
};

type Order = {
  id: string;
  code: string;            // ORD-YYYY-NNN
  pricelistId: string;     // snapshot — even if customer's pricelist changes later, this stays
  customerId?: string;     // undefined for walk-in
  paymentMethod: PaymentMethod;
  lines: OrderLine[];
  subtotal: number;        // sum of line subtotals (pre-tax)
  taxTotal: number;        // sum of line taxes
  total: number;           // subtotal + taxTotal
  status: OrderStatus;
  notes: string;
  createdAt: string;       // ISO datetime
};
```

**All financial and product info is snapshotted onto the order** — product name, variant name, unit code, factor, prices, tax rates, and (per line) `batchAllocations`. If a product is renamed, repriced, or its batches mutated/deleted, historical orders remain accurate and the Consignor Payout report stays correct.

The POS terminal at `/pos` supports **multiple concurrent cart sessions** ("tabs"). The cashier can hold one customer's cart while serving the next — common when a customer steps away to grab something they forgot. A horizontal tab strip at the top of the cart panel shows each open session; clicking switches between them. New tabs auto-create with labels like "Tab 2"; once a customer is selected on a tab, the tab's label switches to the customer's name. Closing a tab with items shows a confirm dialog ("Discard 3 items?"). On Charge, the active session becomes an Order and is removed; if it was the last open tab, a fresh blank "Tab N" is auto-created. Session state lives in `src/lib/stores/cartSessions.svelte.ts` as a singleton — it survives navigating away from `/pos` within the same browser session but does **not** persist across reloads (real production would back this with localStorage or server state).

The POS terminal at `/pos` is a two-pane layout: product grid (left) + cart panel (right) with the tab strip on top of the cart. It resolves prices through the full chain:
- Customer's pricelist drives the active pricelist (walk-in → default)
- Each cart line finds its `PricelistEntry` based on whether it's a base / variant / packaging line
- `priceForQty(entry, qty, cost)` resolves quantity tiers
- Extras add their `priceDelta` per quantity
- `taxRateFor(product)` resolves the chain (product override → category → default tax rate); tax is computed per line and shown both inline and aggregated

**Scan-to-sell.** The search input doubles as a barcode/QR target. Pressing Enter triggers `resolveScanToken(text)`, which matches the typed/scanned text in priority order:
1. Exact `product.sku` (case-insensitive)
2. Exact `variant.sku` (case-insensitive)
3. Exact `batch.code` via `batches.getByCode(code)` — resolves to the batch's product + variantId

On a successful match, the line is added to the cart with the correct variant (if any) at the active pricelist's price, and the input clears. Composite products work too — scanning resolves to the composite product; `applyOrderToStock` then deducts each component normally. If no exact match, the text stays as a search filter (existing behavior).

USB barcode scanners that emulate keyboard + Enter work without extra setup. The QR codes printed on batch labels encode `batch.code`, so scanning a label at POS adds the right SKU. Note that scanning a batch QR is *product identification*, not *batch enforcement* — `applyOrderToStock` still walks FIFO on charge, so the soonest-expiring batch is decremented regardless of which batch was scanned.

`applyOrderToStock(order)` (called on charge) deducts stock by walking `Batch` rows FIFO (oldest `receivedAt` first):
- For simple goods: decrement `qtyRemaining` across batches matching `(productId, variantId?)` until `quantity × unitFactor` is satisfied
- For composite products: same FIFO walk per component (per-variant recipe if variant set, else product-level recipe)
- For each picked extra: walk batches for the extra's components per quantity sold
- Every batch touched is stamped onto the line's `batchAllocations` (snapshot of `batchId`, `qtyTaken`, `ownership`, `unitCost`, `supplierId`). The Consignor Payout report aggregates `batchAllocations` where `ownership === 'consignment'` to compute exact per-supplier payables — see the `Payout` section below.

Cancellation (`orders.cancel(id)`) flips status to `cancelled` AND restocks: walks each line's `batchAllocations` and adds `qtyTaken` back to each original batch's `qtyRemaining`. Batches that have been deleted are skipped silently. The `batchAllocations` snapshot remains on the cancelled order as a historical record of what was originally deducted.

### `Payout` — consignor settlements

Lives in `src/lib/stores/payouts.svelte.ts`. Route at `/payouts`.

```ts
type PayoutMethod = 'cash' | 'transfer' | 'other';

type Payout = {
  id: string;
  code: string;                // PAYOUT-YYYY-NNN
  supplierId: string;
  amount: number;              // IDR
  paidAt: string;              // ISO date
  method: PayoutMethod;
  coversPeriodStart: string;   // ISO date
  coversPeriodEnd: string;     // ISO date
  notes: string;
};
```

A `Payout` records a settlement to a consignor — money out the door. The `/payouts` page computes outstanding payables from `consignmentOwedBySupplier(...)` (which walks paid orders' `batchAllocations`) minus `payouts.paidToSupplier(supplierId, asOf?)`, then offers a Record-payout modal to log new settlements. The page also exposes a Return-stock action backed by `batches.returnToConsignor(batchId, qty)` so a retailer can hand back unsold consignment units without financial impact.

### `Pricelist` (cross-reference)

Lives in `src/lib/stores/pricelists.svelte.ts`. Master-data resource at `/pricelists`.

```ts
type Pricelist = {
  id: string;
  name: string;          // "Retail", "Wholesale", "VIP"
  isDefault: boolean;    // exactly one true; store enforces
  description: string;
};
```

Seed: Retail (default), Wholesale, VIP. The default cannot be deleted; the last remaining list cannot be deleted.

### `TaxRate` and tax resolution

Lives in `src/lib/stores/taxRates.svelte.ts`. Master-data resource at `/taxes`.

```ts
type TaxRate = {
  id: string;
  name: string;          // "PPN 11%", "Tax-exempt", "Zero-rated"
  rate: number;          // percentage (e.g., 11 for 11%)
  description: string;
  isDefault: boolean;    // exactly one true; used when neither product nor category specifies
};
```

Seed: PPN 11% (default), Tax-exempt, Zero-rated. The default cannot be deleted; the last rate cannot be deleted.

**Tax is resolved per product**, not per pricelist or per tier:

- `Category.taxRateId: string` — required. Each category has a default tax rate.
- `Product.taxRateId?: string` — optional override. When unset, the product inherits from its category.
- `taxRateFor(product)` walks the chain: product override → category default → global default. Always returns a TaxRate (or undefined only in degenerate cases).
- `priceWithTax(price, rate)` returns the tax-inclusive price for any computed sale price.

This matches the Indonesian retail reality: most items are PPN 11%, certain items (basic food, education, healthcare per UU HPP) are exempt, and you set this at the category level so individual products rarely need to override. The override exists for cases where one product within a category has a different status.

---

## Key decisions and why

These are load-bearing. If you disagree, change them deliberately — don't accidentally undo them.

### 1. No `margin_pct` strategy — markup only

Originally we had four strategies (fixed, markup_amount, markup_pct, margin_pct). Margin was removed because **markup is more intuitive for product pricing**. Markup answers "how much do I add to cost?"; margin answers "what fraction of sale is profit?". Both are real, but small retailers think in markup. Margin% is still displayed as informational text in the `PricingInput` preview alongside markup%.

### 2. Sale price is computed, never stored

`PricelistEntry.pricing` is the *strategy*; the actual price number is computed on read via `computeSalePrice`. Reason: when supplier cost changes (eventually via Purchase Orders), all markup-based prices auto-update without writes. UI should never multiply/add directly — use `basePrice(p)`, `priceRange(p)`, `priceForQty(entry, qty, cost)`.

### 3. Pricing is per-row, not just per-product

Each `ProductVariant`, `ProductPackaging`, and the `Product` itself has its own `prices: PricelistEntry[]`. A premium variant can have its own markup; a wholesale-only 24-pack can have its own tier ladder. Variant `cost` is also per-variant (a Brand Blue mug may cost more than White).

### 4. Pricelists rendered as a vertical list, not tabs

The form renders each pricelist as a stacked card. We tried tabs first; the problem was **hidden state** — errors on inactive tabs were invisible, and users developed anxiety about "what's in the other tab." The vertical list shows everything at once. Adding/removing a pricelist cascades the change to **all** variants and packagings to keep entries in sync.

### 5. `advanced: boolean` was dropped

There used to be `advanced: boolean` on Product that gated the form's packagings/variants visibility. It was removed because:
- It bundled three orthogonal features into one toggle
- "Advanced" is a meaningless label — users don't know what they're opting into
- It can be derived: `isAdvanced(p)` from data presence

Form now uses **progressive disclosure** — opt-in chips like `+ Add packaging`, `+ Add variants`. Sections appear only when populated.

### 6. Cost lives on batches; `product.cost` is a manual bootstrap fallback

Each `Batch` carries its own `unitCost` snapshotted at receipt time, and `currentCost(productId, variantId?)` returns the weighted average across remaining **owned** batches. `product.cost` / `variant.cost` are not auto-updated by `receive()` any more — they exist only as:
- The bootstrap value used by pricing math (`computeSalePrice`, `priceForQty`) before any batches exist for a product
- A manual fallback that's still editable in the product form

Consignment batches are deliberately excluded from `currentCost` since they aren't part of our cost basis. See [`CONSIGNMENT.md`](./CONSIGNMENT.md) §"Cost" for the full rationale.

### 7. Variant generator preserves edits on regenerate

When the user clicks "Generate variants" with attributes set, we don't wipe existing variants. `regenerateVariants` matches by `values: Record<string, string>` and preserves edited rows whose combo still exists. Orphans (combos no longer in the attribute set) are dropped. Manual variants (empty `values`) are also dropped. This is non-destructive enough that no confirm dialog is needed.

### 8. Quantity tiers stored per pricelist entry, not per product

`PricelistEntry.tiers` lives inside the entry, not at the product level. This is critical for the "wholesale customers get more aggressive volume tiers than retail" scenario — same product, different ladders per customer tier. `priceForQty(entry, qty, cost)` returns the right price for any quantity by walking tiers (highest matching `minQty` wins).

### 9. Currency is Indonesian Rupiah throughout

Locale `id-ID`, 0 fraction digits, dot as thousands separator (e.g., `Rp 25.000`). Helpers in `src/lib/utils/currency.ts` — `formatRupiah`, `formatRupiahNumber`, `parseRupiahNumber`. All monetary inputs use `<MoneyInput>` which formats live with thousand separators and preserves cursor position. If you ever change currency, change there and the seed prices.

### Tax

Tax is **always resolved through the fallback chain**: product override → category default → global default. The system never assumes "no tax" silently — there's always a resolved TaxRate, even if its rate is 0. This makes reports and POS calculations predictable.

Tax rate ≠ tax included in price. The PricelistEntry pricing is **tax-exclusive**. `priceWithTax(salePrice, rate)` computes the tax-inclusive figure. At the POS, you typically display tax-inclusive prices to walk-in customers (Indonesian retail convention) but break out the tax line on the receipt. The data model supports both views.

If you change tax behavior (e.g., display tax-inclusive in pricelists), do it in helpers, not by mutating stored values. Stored prices stay tax-exclusive.

### 10. UI primitives vs product-domain components

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Reusable across any feature | `src/lib/components/ui/` | `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Modal`, `Card`, `Table`, `PricingInput`, `MoneyInput`, `ChipInput`, `Collapsible`, etc. Re-exported from `index.ts`. |
| Product-domain specific | `src/lib/components/products/` | `ProductForm.svelte`, `TierEditor.svelte` |

When in doubt, default to `ui/` only if it's truly generic. The product form and tier editor know about the product model and stay in `products/`.

---

## Form UX principles

The form (`ProductForm.svelte`) follows these rules. Future changes should respect them.

1. **Simple by default.** First-time user adding "Espresso, Rp 25.000" sees only Basics + Pricing (single pricelist) + Stock. Nothing else.

2. **Opt-in via chips.** New features (packagings, variants, additional pricelists, volume tiers) are added via labeled dashed-border chips. Clicking creates the first row and reveals its section.

3. **Cards, not tabs.** Major concepts (Basics, Pricing & inventory, Packagings, Variants, Organization) each get their own Card. Conditional cards (Packagings, Variants) only render when their data exists.

4. **Collapsible for repeat patterns.** Volume tier editors and per-pricelist pricing blocks inside variant/packaging cards use `<Collapsible>` to stay compact. The header summary shows current state (e.g., `Volume tiers (3)`, or `Sale pricing — Rp 150.000 (Retail) +1`).

5. **Sticky bottom action bar.** Cancel / Save stay on screen regardless of scroll position.

6. **Validation surfaces inline AND via toast.** Per-field errors render below their input. If submit blocks, a single toast tells the user to "fix the highlighted fields." All pricelists' entries are validated on every submit — no hidden errors.

7. **No tabs anywhere in the form.** Tabs hide state. We tried them for pricelists, removed them. Don't reintroduce them without a strong reason.

| `pricingKindOptions` | `{value, label}[]` | For Select. |

### Variant generator

| Helper | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `activeAttributes(attrs)` | `ProductAttribute[]` | Filters out attrs with empty name or no values. |
| `variantCombinations(attrs)` | `Record<string,string>[]` | Cartesian product. |
| `valuesMatch(a, b)` | `boolean` | Same keys + same values. |
| `generateVariants(attrs, defaults)` | `ProductVariant[]` | Fresh generation, ignores existing. |
| `regenerateVariants(attrs, existing, defaults)` | `ProductVariant[]` | Preserves edits on matching combos. |

### Product introspection

| Helper | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `isAdvanced(p)` | `boolean` | True if packagings/variants/attributes exist. |
| `isComposite(p)` | `boolean` | True if `p.components.length > 0` (legacy — prefer `p.kind === 'composite'`). |
| `effectiveCost(p)` | `number` | For composites: `sum(qty × componentCost)`. For simple: `p.cost`. |
| `effectiveVariantCost(v)` | `number` | Per-variant: `sum(qty × componentCost)` if `v.components` non-empty, else `v.cost`. |
| `producibleStock(p)` | `number` | For composites: limited by rarest component (via `stockOf` per component). For simple: `stockOf(p.id)`. |
| `producibleVariantStock(productId, v)` | `number` | Per-variant: limited by rarest component if `v.components` non-empty, else `stockOf(productId, v.id)`. Signature gained `productId` so it can query batches. |
| `totalStock(p)` | `number` | Variants: sum of `producibleVariantStock(p.id, v)`. Composites (no variants): `producibleStock`. Else: `stockOf(p.id)`. |
| `pricelistEntries(p)` | `Set<string>` | All pricelist IDs across product, variants, packagings. |
| `hasAnyTier(p)` | `boolean` | True if any entry anywhere has tiers. |

| `priceWithTax(price, rate)` | `number` | Tax-inclusive of a sale price. |
| `defaultSupplier(p)` | `Supplier \| undefined` | Resolves `p.defaultSupplierId` to a Supplier; undefined if id is stale. |
| `purchaseOrders.hasConsignmentFor(productId)` | `boolean` | True if any non-cancelled consignment PO references this product. |
| `purchaseOrders.receive(id)` | `{ ok, reason? }` | Marks PO as received. Creates one `Batch` per line (ownership derived from PO type). No scalar `product.stock` / `product.cost` write. |
| `stockOf(productId, variantId?)` | `number` | Live stock — sum of `qtyRemaining` across matching batches. The single source of truth. |
| `stockBreakdown(productId, variantId?)` | `{ owned, consignment }` | Same as `stockOf` but split by ownership. For displays like "80 owned + 10 consignment". |
| `currentCost(productId, variantId?)` | `number` | Weighted avg of owned batches' `unitCost` across `qtyRemaining`; falls back to `product.cost` / `variant.cost` when no owned batches exist. Consignment batches excluded (not our cost basis). |
| `batches.forStock(productId, variantId?)` | `Batch[]` | FIFO-ordered batches with `qtyRemaining > 0`. Sort key: `expiresAt` ASC first (perishables sell first), then `receivedAt` ASC as fallback. Used by `applyOrderToStock` and any FIFO-walk caller. |
| `batches.forSupplier(supplierId, ownership?)` | `Batch[]` | Supplier-scoped batch list. Powers the consignor payout / return flows. |
| `batches.forSourcePO(poId)` | `Batch[]` | All batches created from a given PO, sorted by `receivedAt` ASC. Drives `/inventory/po/[poId]/labels`. |
| `batches.getByCode(code)` | `Batch \| undefined` | Look up by human-readable `BATCH-YYYY-NNN`. Used by the POS scan flow. |
| `batches.adjustStock({ productId, variantId?, delta, unitCost, notes? })` | `void` | Manual stock adjustment. Positive delta → new owned batch. Negative → LIFO decrement across owned batches (preserves FIFO order for future sales). Used by the product form save. |
| `batches.forProduct(productId)` | `Batch[]` | All batches for a product (across variants, including depleted), sorted by `receivedAt` ASC. Drives the per-product Batches modal on the products list. |
| `batches.returnToConsignor(batchId, qty)` | `{ ok, reason? }` | Decrements a consignment batch's `qtyRemaining`. No payable, no revenue. Used by the Return-stock modal on `/payouts`. |
| `consignmentOwedBySupplier({ start?, end? })` | `Map<supplierId, { units, amount }>` | Aggregates per-supplier consignment payable from paid orders' `batchAllocations` in a date range. Drives the Outstanding card on `/payouts`. |
| `payouts.add(input)` | `Payout` | Records a settlement to a supplier; auto-generates `PAYOUT-YYYY-NNN` code. |
| `payouts.paidToSupplier(supplierId, asOf?)` | `number` | Sum of recorded payouts to a supplier, optionally up to a cutoff date. The Outstanding column subtracts this from the owed amount. |
| `purchaseOrders.markSent(id)` | `{ ok, reason? }` | Transitions draft → sent. |
| `purchaseOrders.cancel(id)` | `{ ok, reason? }` | Transitions draft or sent → cancelled. |
| `poTotal(po)` | `number` | Sum of line subtotals. |
| `lineSubtotal(line)` | `number` | `quantity × unitPrice`. |
| `lineBaseQuantity(line)` | `number` | `quantity × unitFactor` — converted to base units. |
| `lineBaseUnitCost(line)` | `number` | `unitPrice / unitFactor` — per-base-unit price for cost math. |
| `products.countByCategory(id)` | `number` | Used by Categories page badge. |
| `products.countByUnit(id)` | `number` | Used by Units page badge. |
| `products.countByPricelist(id)` | `number` | Used by Pricelist page (not yet wired). |

### Currency (`src/lib/utils/currency.ts`)

| Helper | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `formatRupiah(value)` | `string` | `Rp 25.000`. Returns `—` for non-finite. |
| `formatRupiahNumber(value)` | `string` | `25.000` (no symbol). |
| `parseRupiahNumber(input)` | `number` | Strips non-digits. |

## Conventions when extending

- **State management:** `$state`-backed class singletons in `src/lib/stores/*.svelte.ts`. See `toast.svelte.ts` (simple) and `products.svelte.ts` (complex) for patterns.
- **New master-data resource:** mirror the Categories / Units pattern — store with seed + `add` / `update` / `remove` / `getById`, Modal-based form for create/edit, `<ConfirmDialog>` for delete, add a nav item to the Master Data group in `Sidebar.svelte`.
- **Money:** always use `<MoneyInput>` for input, `formatRupiah()` for display. Never raw number inputs for currency.
- **Pricing math:** always go through `computeSalePrice` / `priceForQty` / `basePrice` / `priceRange`. Don't multiply/add directly.
- **Pricelist sync:** when adding or removing a pricelist on a product, mirror the change to every variant and packaging (see `addProductPricelist` / `removeProductPricelist` in `ProductForm.svelte`). Lookups gracefully fall back to the default pricelist, but writes should be explicit.
- **New UI primitive:** `src/lib/components/ui/`, exported from `index.ts`. Keep it generic (no domain knowledge).
- **Routes:** `+page.svelte` under `src/routes/<slug>/`. Dynamic params: `src/routes/<slug>/[id]/+page.svelte`. SvelteKit's `page.params.id` is typed as `string | undefined` — handle the missing case.
- **Frontend stack:** Svelte 5 runes only — no legacy `let`/stores. Tailwind v4 utilities. `lucide-svelte` for icons.
- **Validation:** inline errors per field + a single toast on submit. Don't show validation walls.
- **Form sections:** Cards, not tabs. Progressive disclosure for optional features.

## What's intentionally deferred

These exist in the mental model but aren't built:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Receipt printing | Not built | Order detail page is receipt-ready in layout; integrating ESC/POS or browser print is a future task. |
| Refunds / returns | Not built | Line-level partial refunds. Whole-order cancellation already restocks via `batchAllocations` replay (see `orders.cancel`). |
| Order discounts | Not built | Neither line-level nor order-level discounts implemented. Would add `discount: PricingStrategy` per line and per order. |
| Session persistence across reloads | Not built | Multi-session ("tabs") works, but state lives in memory. Backing with localStorage or a server-side store is future work for real cashier workflows. |
| Image upload | Not built | `imageUrl` is a URL string only. Backend needed for file uploads; storage choice (S3, local) and thumbnail generation TBD. |
| Excel/CSV import (`/products/import`) | Not built | Planned. Will use SheetJS `xlsx` client-side, row-per-SKU flat format with `Parent SKU` for variants, attribute columns (`Color`, `Size`), one price column per pricelist (`Retail Price`, `Wholesale Price`). Pricing strategies + tiers will be UI-only (import sets fixed prices) |
| Accounts Payable for POs | Not built | Currently receive() updates stock + cost, but no AP entry is created. When accounting lands, standard POs will create AP on receipt; consignment POs will create AP per-sale instead. |
| Customer → pricelist assignment | Not built | At checkout, a customer's `pricelistId` should drive `priceForQty` lookup |
| Orphaned `PricelistEntry` cleanup | Not done | When a Pricelist is deleted, dangling entries on products are harmless (fallback to default) but a sweep helper would tidy things |
| Backwards-compatible accordion on cards | Considered | If the form ever feels too long for products with both packagings and variants, make the card headers collapsible (accordion) rather than introduce tabs |
| Inventory movement log | Not built | Adjustments and sales create batches / decrement `qtyRemaining`, but there's no audit log surface. Could derive from batch creation timestamps + order batchAllocations for a future Movement view. |
| Multi-warehouse / location | Not built | Would need a `Location` resource and stock split across locations |

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Base unit** | The smallest unit you count in (e.g., `pcs`). Lives on `Product.unitId`. |
| **Packaging** | An alternative sellable form, e.g., a box of 24. `factor` is how many base units it contains. |
| **Variant** | A variation of a product (Red/M T-shirt vs Blue/L T-shirt). Each has own SKU, cost, prices, stock. |
| **Attribute** | An option type (`Color`, `Size`). Has a name + list of values. Used by the variant generator. |
| **Pricelist** | A customer tier (Retail, Wholesale, VIP). Determines which `PricelistEntry` applies. |
| **Pricelist entry** | A product's (or variant's, or packaging's) sale pricing for one pricelist. Has a base strategy + optional volume tiers. |
| **Pricing strategy** | How sale price relates to cost. Fixed price, cost + amount, or cost × markup%. |
| **Tier** | A higher-quantity override inside a pricelist entry. `{minQty, pricing}`. Highest matching `minQty` wins. |
| **Cost** | Per-base-unit cost. Lives on individual `Batch` rows (`unitCost`); the manual `product.cost` is a bootstrap fallback used when no owned batches exist. `currentCost(productId, variantId?)` returns the weighted average across remaining owned batches. |
| **Sale price** | What the customer pays. Computed from `cost + pricing` at read time. Never stored. |
| **Markup %** | Pricing strategy: `sale = cost × (1 + pct/100)`. |
| **Cost + amount** | Pricing strategy: `sale = cost + amount`. |
| **Fixed price** | Pricing strategy: `sale = value`, ignores cost. |
| **Tax rate** | A percentage applied on top of sale price (e.g., PPN 11%). Resolved per product via fallback chain. |
| **PPN** | Pajak Pertambahan Nilai — Indonesian VAT, standard 11% per UU HPP. |
| **Consignment / titipan** | Inventory supplied by a vendor that the store doesn't pay for until sold. Tracked via consignment-type Purchase Orders rather than a flag on the product. |
| **Supplier** | A vendor that supplies products via Purchase Orders. Master-data resource at `/suppliers`. |
| **Purchase Order (PO)** | A document recording an order placed with a supplier. Has a type (`standard` / `consignment`) that drives AP behavior on receipt. |
| **Goods receipt** | The act of marking a PO as received. Creates one `Batch` row per line; no scalar stock or cost mutation. |
| **Batch** | One received quantity of a (product, variant?) with its own `unitCost`, `qtyRemaining`, `ownership` (`owned` \| `consignment`), source PO, and `receivedAt` date. The single source of truth for stock. See [`CONSIGNMENT.md`](./CONSIGNMENT.md). |
| **Batch ownership** | `owned` (the retailer paid for it via a standard PO or initial seeding) or `consignment` (the consignor still owns it; we owe per-unit only on sale). `currentCost` only averages owned batches. |
| **FIFO depletion** | Sale deducts from batches ordered by `receivedAt` ASC. `applyOrderToStock` walks `batches.forStock(...)` and decrements `qtyRemaining` oldest-first. |
| **Stock adjustment** | Manual change to on-hand quantity that doesn't come from a PO or sale (write-off, found stock, count correction, initial seed via the product form). Positive deltas create a new owned batch; negative deltas LIFO-decrement owned batches. |
| **Composite product** | A product built from other products (bundles, recipes, manufactured goods). `kind === 'composite'`; `cost` and `stock` are derived from components. |
| **Bundle** | A composite product whose components are typically sold individually too (e.g., "Coffee + Croissant Combo"). |
| **BOM (Bill of Materials)** | A composite product whose components are ingredients (e.g., "Mie Tek-Tek = noodle + egg + mayo"). Same data model as bundle; intent differs. |
| **Product kind** | The discriminator `'goods' \| 'composite'` chosen at the top of the product form. Filters which feature chips (packagings, components) appear. |
| **Per-variant recipe** | Each variant of a composite product can have its own `components` array, so e.g. Combo Small / Medium / Large can have different ingredient quantities. |
| **Extras / modifiers** | Optional add-ons picked at sale time (sauces, toppings, gift wrap). Each has a price delta and optional stock impact. Apply to either kind. |
| **Lead time** | Typical days from placing an order to receiving goods. Stored on Supplier. Used for reorder-point math (future). |
